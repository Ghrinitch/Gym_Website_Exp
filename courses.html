        <p class="text">What’s the first thing you think of when you hear “cardio?” Probably running, maybe the elliptical machine, stationary bike, or even rowing. But there’s so much more to cardio than steady-state endurance workouts—a.k.a. trucking it for the long-haul.
The best kind of cardio exercises are compound exercises, which involve multiple joints and more than one muscle group.</p>
